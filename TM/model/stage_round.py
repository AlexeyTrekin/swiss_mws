    For example, if the tournament is with groups, the stage contains all the fights in the groups
    (because they all are defined at once)
    In case of swiss or playoff, only one round is included in the stage, b
    ecause the fights in the next round are defined only when the previous finished

    The stage inherits the tournament rules (?)
